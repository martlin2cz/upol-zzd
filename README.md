# upol-zzd

The implementation of some data mining techniques. It is my semmester's final project of KMI/ZZD course. See http://phoenix.inf.upol.cz/~konecnja/vyuka/2016S/ZZD.html for more info. 

Currently implemented:
 - [x] Hubert's algorithm (on Iris dataset)
 - [x] OPTICS (on Iris dataset)
 - [ ] Optimal cluster count (on Iris dataset)
 - [x] Apriori algorithm (on Congressional Voting Records)
 - [x] Decision tree (on Congressional Voting Records)
 
 See classes inside the `cz.martlin.upol.zzd.demos` package to see demonstrations of listed techniques. Or the JUnit tests of particular algorithms for some small testing datasets.
 
 This is currently version to submit. If succeeds, no future development will be done.
